1. Rewrite TTYserial::begin so that if a particular TTYserial object has been 
   called with a new port and/or baud rate, close the original port and open the 
   new port with the new settings. 

2. Add a close function and getter functions that return the current port and 
   baudrate of any TTYserial object.

3. Add network map functions to xbeeDMapi. 
   *** Added the AT-ND command to xbeeDMapi but need to account for receiving a packet
   from the response in the receiver functions. 
   
   Need to write a class to actually hold the network map.
