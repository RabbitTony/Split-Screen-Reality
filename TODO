1. Rewrite TTYserial::begin so that if a particular TTYserial object has been 
   called with a new port and/or baud rate, close the original port and open the 
   new port with the new settings. 

2. Add a close function and getter functions that return the current port and 
   baudrate of any TTYserial object.

3. Add network map functions to xbeeDMapi.
