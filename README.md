Split-Screen-Reality
====================

The code repository for the Split Screen Reality, USF, senior design project. 

This repository will contain the most recent and up to date code for the project.
The code includes a makefile and is intended to be run on linux (Raspbian). Once
the entire source has been downloaded, the user needs to enter the linux command
"make" while in the same directory as the source code and the linux compiler will 
automatically build and compile the source code.
