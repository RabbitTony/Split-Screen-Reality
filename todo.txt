***************************TASKS**********************

1) Need to write a function that does data logging so that I can have some sort
of debugging messages from this thing. 

2) Add system calls to the VCR.



***************************NOTES**********************

1) I have the packet structure decided on that 5 bytes of data will signify the 
packet contains a command. 6 Bytes and up will be a video packet. The first byte 
is the command and the next 4 will be 0x02 0x03 0x05 0x07 -- The first 4 primes. 
The likelihood of this occuring at random is very small. 
	1.1) This means that for the last video packet, the end needs to be padded
	with enough bytes to make it more than 5 bytes longs (I could do < / > but 
	a single direction makes more sense. I'll added a repeating pattern of
	0x11, 0x13, 0x11, . . . . A repeating pattern of 2 digit primes. Obviously,
	I need to check the last byte of video data, it cannot be the first number
	of the pattern. So if it is 0x11 or 0x13, use the opposite number to start. 

2) The command packets will use the "task" bytes as the first byte in the payload
to represent the command packets.
